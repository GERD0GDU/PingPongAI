# What Is AI, What It Is Not, Its Relation to Code

## Introduction to the AI Concept

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is **the ability of machines to perform human-like tasks**.
AI does not only mean "robots" or "conscious machines". AI operates with **data, algorithms, and decision mechanisms**.

## What AI Is Not

- AI is **not a magical solution** - running a ready-made library does not always produce the correct result.
- AI **does not learn by itself just by receiving data** - model and algorithm design are required.
- AI is **not an exact imitation of human intelligence** - it provides optimization for specific tasks.

## Types of AI (Short and Clear)

- **Narrow AI:** Optimized for a single task, for example a program that plays chess.
- **General AI:** Human-like multi-task learning ability (does not exist yet).
- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subfield of AI where the model learns from data.
- **Deep Learning (DL):** Learning with multi-layer neural networks, especially used for vision, audio, and language.

## Relation to Code

AI projects are tightly integrated with software development:

- **Data processing:** Python, C#, SQL, CSV, JSON
- **Model building:** Neural networks, reinforcement learning, decision trees
- **Algorithm implementation:** Weight updates, backpropagation, optimization

> AI is not about "running a ready-made library" - it requires designing models and testing their behaviors by writing code.

## Example Connection with Ping-Pong

- In this project, AI learns **to control a table tennis paddle**.
- Code side: read ball position, move the paddle, apply reward - punishment mechanisms.
- Goal: **to see step by step how AI learns** and to break the "black box" perception.

In the next document, we will move on to the topic of
[**the concept of learning**](./01-WhatIsLearning.md).
