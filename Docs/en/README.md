## Why Does This Project Exist?

This project was not created to build a product, but to understand a concept.

Today, the concept of AI is used very frequently. However, it is often presented like this:

- ready-made libraries
- black-box models
- complex mathematics
- a "use this, get the result" approach

This approach creates the following feeling, especially for developers with a software background but no AI experience:

> AI feels distant to me. As if it only belongs to academics or big companies!

This project exists exactly to break that perception.

## Source of Inspiration

What made me think about this project was watching the following documentary about DeepMind on YouTube:

[![The Thinking Game](https://img.youtube.com/vi/d95J8yzvjbQ/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/d95J8yzvjbQ)

In the documentary, Demis Hassabis' approach especially caught my attention:

- not treating AI as a closed technology
- seeing it as a shared problem of humanity
- the desire to share generated knowledge as openly as possible

The motivation of "doing something useful for the world" showed how an abstract and complex field like AI can actually carry a very human purpose.

This project is a small - modest reflection of that approach.

## Why Ping-Pong?

The ping-pong game I saw in the documentary is a deliberate choice for this project.

Because ping-pong:

- has very simple rules
- has an observable environment
- has a clear decision - outcome relationship
- shows success and failure instantly

Thanks to these characteristics, ping-pong provides an ideal laboratory to explain the logic of AI learning.

The goal is:

- not to write an AI that "plays well"
- but to observe step by step how AI learns

## Who Is This Project For?

This project is especially designed for the following people:

- software developers with no AI experience at all
- those who wonder "what is going on behind the AI?"
- those who want to learn without using ready-made libraries
- those looking for a Turkish, simple, and explanatory resource

Including myself.

## Why Open Source?

This project was designed as open source from start to finish.

Because:

- AI is a collective body of knowledge
- the best way to learn is to share
- this repository is not a showcase, but a learning notebook
- this is why documentation is as important as the code itself

Every folder, every file, every line should answer the following question:

> What does this do - and why is it like this?

## How Was This Document Prepared?

This document is not a manifesto written alone.

The documentation and project structure in this repository were shaped as a result of dialogues between:

- a software developer trying to learn the subject
- and an artificial intelligence model

But there is an important point here:

The artificial intelligence did not write this document alone.

On the human side:

- questions
- objections
- simplification requests
- points where it was said "this should not be like this"

determined the direction of the text.

Therefore, the resulting content:

- does not claim to be a perfect transfer of knowledge
- reflects the learning process as it is
- is intentionally kept simple and explanatory

This transparency is one of the core principles of this project.

In the next document, we will look for an answer to the question [**What is AI**](./00-WhatIsAI.md).
